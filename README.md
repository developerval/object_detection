# Object Detection application

## Requirements

### This application will require permissions to use your camera

### In order for this application to work correctly, the first frame detected by the camera must be an empty scene.

### The application will then determine when new objects enter the scene and highlight them to show that motion has been detected

## Modules used

### OpenCV, time

## Improvements to be made

### The threshold at which objects are detected is too low, meaning that many objects are selected that shouldnt be like shadows, slight changes in light etc. I'd like to do some research into how to minimise this in the application in order to use this for another project with my Raspberry Pi.
